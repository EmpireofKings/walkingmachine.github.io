After participating for many years in the Walking Machine SAE and the Eurobot competitions subsequently, since 2016, we are competing in the Robocup@Home international competition.

## Robocup@Home in a few lines

The RoboCup@Home is held during the Robocup, the most important robotics competition in the world. The latter also showcase the Soccer, Rescue, and Junior categories. This event, held once a year, brings together university and college from across the world.

RoboCup@Home aims to develop robots for personal assistance with the aim of creating the perfect assistant in everyday tasks. To find the best robots, the teams make their robot do a series of tests to measure their skills and performance in an house like environment. The main fields of development are: Human-machine interaction and cooperation, navigation and mapping in dynamic environment, computer vision and recognition of objects under different light, objects manipulation and artificial intelligence.

The events are presented in the form of scenarios spread out over two levels of difficulty. Thus, after passing the qualification phase, the robots are confronted with level 1 scenarios. The robots that scored the most access level 2. The five teams who have accumulated the most points during the past scenarios access to the final round. The winning robot is the one who has accumulated the most points throughout the different heats.

## Last year s scenarios

#### Level I
* Follow a person
* Clean a room
* Facial recognition and facial association
* Free demonstration of the robot

#### Level II
* Service robot
* Waiter in a restaurant
* Demonstration of the robot

#### Final heat
* Demonstration of the robot

In brief, the competition presents a great level of challenge and contributes greatly to advancing domestic robotics.
