After participating for many years to the Walking Machine SAE and the Eurobot subsequently, since 2016, we participate to the Robocup@Home international competition.

## Robocup@Home in brief

The RoboCup@Home competition is held during the Robocup, the most important competition of Robotics in the world. The latter also presents the Soccer, Rescue and Junior categories. This event held once a year, brings together university and college from across the world.

RoboCup@Home aims to develop robots for personal assistance with the aim of creating the perfect assistant in the tasks of everyday life. To determine the best robots, the teams move to their robot a series of tests to measure their skills and performance in an environment simulating a House. The main axes of development are: Human-machine interaction and cooperation, navigation and mapping in dynamic environment, computer vision and recognition of objects under different light, object manipulation and artificial intelligence.

The events are presented in the form of scenario spread out over two levels. Thus, After passing the qualification phase, the robots are confronted with scenarios of the level 1. The robots having the most points access level 2. The five teams who have accumulated the most points during the scenarios past access to the final round. The winning robot is the one who has accumulated the most points throughout his career.

## Les scénarios de l'année 2015-2016

#### Niveau I
* Follow a person
* Clean a room
* Recognition and association of persons
* Free demonstration of the robot

#### Niveau II
* Service robot
* Server in a restaurant
* Free demonstration of the robot

#### Ronde finale
* Free demonstration

In brief, the competition presents a great level of challenge and contributed greatly to advancing domestic Robotics.
