## SOCIAL MISSION

The Walking Machine club is, before everything, a way to learn. Its members gain knowledge through practice in the different fields of ingeeneering. The scientific club has also a social mission, to help citizen with reduced mobility, due to the nature of the competition in which it participates. By developping robots able to accomplish simple domestic tasks, we seek to make life easier for our elders. On another level, we also want to inspire youth, by showing up to diverse promotional events in highschool and colleges. 

## PHILOSOPHY

The clubs philosophy is being open to give back to the community. In fact, we will use free software before using proprietary software to accomplish our goals. This choice is motivated by the hope of sharing universal knowledge. We are also a multidisciplinary team with a divers background. This helps us build the best robot possible using a multitude of technologies. This helps to developp knowledge to the largest amount of people in connex fields, which would otherwise be almost unaccesible. Our team members are not separated by disciplins, but by projects, and everyone's ideas are considered. 



## ORIGINS

The Walking Machine club used to participate in the SAE Walking Machine Student Collegiate Design Series. The club was founded in 1995. The original goal of the club was to build an autonomous robot. We are one of the oldest robotic club at Ã‰TS. Through out the years and different competitions, the club evolved greatly, but its innovative spirit remains.
