## S.A.R.A
Depuis le début de sa participation à la [Robocup@Home](http://www.robocupathome.org/), notre équipe à fait de multiple avancement sur notre belle S.A.R.A (Système d'Assistance Robotique Autonome). Sa tache est simple, , our team has made multiple advancement on our lovely S.A.R.A, french for Autonomus robotics assistance system. Her main goal is to be able to help people at home for day to day task, our task is to make her the must fonctionnal doing her work.

## Our projects
To accomplish this really big project we have divided our entire group in different [team](/en/team) with each their own project. Most of then vary every year. For this year here are the most important project by departement :

# [Mecanic](https://github.com/WalkingMachine/sara_commun/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3A%22Team+%3A+MEC%22)

* Optimize the bottom of the structure
* Design a new layout for the computer in the robot

# [Electrical](https://github.com/WalkingMachine/sara_commun/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3A%22Team+%3A+%C3%89L%C3%89%22)

* Implement the CanOpen protocol for most of the hardware
* Rewire the entire robot to simplify it
* Add sound localization capabilities

# [Software](https://github.com/WalkingMachine/sara_commun/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3A%22Team+%3A+LOG%22)

* Implement 3D object detection
* Facial expression and gender recognition
* Optimize our ROS package to have a better code coverage

All of our project are hosted on [GitHub](https://github.com/WalkingMachine) and are entirely open source under the MIT Licence which can be found in all our repositery. Feel free to go look at our code and offer us your help or ask us any question on our conception process. Who know we might end up helping each other building the next most important robot!

All our software is designed for [ROS](http://www.ros.org/), the Robot Operating System. This is a long time decision to make our developement easier and to make sure it could be used or reimplemented if need in new robot.
